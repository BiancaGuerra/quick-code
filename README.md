**read_save_files.py:** This script provides tools for data processing, specifically designed to handle Excel and CSV files using the Pandas library. It contains two primary functions. The first one reads an Excel file with multiple sheets and consolidates all sheets into a single Pandas DataFrame. The second one reads a CSV file and an Excel file, merges them based on designated key columns, and saves the merged data into a new Excel file. Together, these functions streamline data importation, merging, and organization, making it easier for users to manage and analyze datasets from various sources.

**sap_automation.py:** This script automates the login process to the SAP GUI and converts extracted TXT files into CSV format. It checks if the SAP Logon application is running, retrieves user credentials from a specified file, and manages the login process. Additionally, it processes TXT files by removing unnecessary lines and formatting the data, ultimately saving the output as a CSV file. The script measures and displays the total execution time for the entire automation process.

Certainly! Here’s a concise summary of the complete file that contains both functions:

**vba_macro.py:** This script contains three functions for extracting and utilizing VBA macros in Excel files. The first function extracts the VBA macro from a specified XLSM file and saves it as `vbaProject.bin`. The second one adds this VBA macro to an existing XLSX file and saves it as a new XLSM file. Finally, the last one opens the newly created XLSM file, executes the specified VBA macro, and saves the changes.
