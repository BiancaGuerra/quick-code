sap_automation.py: This script automates the login process to the SAP GUI and converts extracted TXT files into CSV format. It checks if the SAP Logon application is running, retrieves user credentials from a specified file, and manages the login process. Additionally, it processes TXT files by removing unnecessary lines and formatting the data, ultimately saving the output as a CSV file. The script measures and displays the total execution time for the entire automation process.
