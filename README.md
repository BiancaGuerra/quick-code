**sap_automation.py:** This script automates the login process to the SAP GUI and converts extracted TXT files into CSV format. It checks if the SAP Logon application is running, retrieves user credentials from a specified file, and manages the login process. Additionally, it processes TXT files by removing unnecessary lines and formatting the data, ultimately saving the output as a CSV file. The script measures and displays the total execution time for the entire automation process.

**read_save_files.py:** This script provides tools for data processing, specifically designed to handle Excel and CSV files using the Pandas library. It contains two primary functions. The first one reads an Excel file with multiple sheets and consolidates all sheets into a single Pandas DataFrame. The second one reads a CSV file and an Excel file, merges them based on designated key columns, and saves the merged data into a new Excel file. Together, these functions streamline data importation, merging, and organization, making it easier for users to manage and analyze datasets from various sources.
